# EmoITA
This repository contains EmoITA, the first text corpus manually annotated with emotion dimensions according to the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) model.

You can find the corpus inside the corpus subfolder. 

The dataset was used for the shared task EmotivITA (https://sites.google.com/view/emotivita) at the EVALITA 2023 evaluation campaign (https://www.evalita.it/campaigns/evalita-2023/). Files from the shared task are available inside the EmotivITA subfolder.
