# EmoITA
## Overview
This repository contains EmoITA, the first text corpus manually annotated with emotion dimensions according to the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) model. In order to produce it, 16 students from the Master’s Degree in Foreign Languages at the University of Catania were asked to translate to Italian the [EmoBank corpus](https://github.com/JULIELab/EmoBank/tree/master) (Buechel and Hahn, 2017). All of them were Italian native speakers and were specializing in English. The same group of subjects also labeled each Italian sentence according to the emotion evoked in an average reader. We took care never to ask a participant to annotate a sentence he had translated. 

You can find the corpus inside the corpus subfolder. 

The dataset was used for the shared task EmotivITA (https://sites.google.com/view/emotivita) at the EVALITA 2023 evaluation campaign (https://www.evalita.it/campaigns/evalita-2023/). Files from the shared task are available inside the EmotivITA subfolder.

## Attribution of Raw Data
As already remarked, the sentences in EmoITA were translated from those in the [EmoBank corpus](https://github.com/JULIELab/EmoBank/blob/master/corpus/emobank.csv). Emobank was gathered from [MASC](https://anc.org/data/masc/), the Manually Annotated SubCorpus of the ANC (Ide et al., 2010) and the [SemEval 2007 Task 14](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/affectivetext/#datasets) (Strapparava & Mihalcea, 2007).
